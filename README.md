# subspace-clustering in the '/gitlocal' folder
mainly aimed at scalable subspace clustering
1.Subspace clustering methods are organized in folders '/ORPCA, /OLRSC, /LRR, /SSC, /NLRRSS'

2.NLRR ('NLRR.m', 'NLRRE.m') and NLRR++ ('NLRRplus.m', 'NLRRplusE.m') functions are displayed in the folder'/NLRRSS' ;
3.all executable files are named as 'test**.m' which can be executed directly;
4.datasets: 'Imagenet'(features trained by CNN), 'MNIST', 'SVHN', 'USPS', 'Protein';
5.clustering baseline and evaluation metric function are in the '/clusterings' folder.
