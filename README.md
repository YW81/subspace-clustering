# subspace-clustering in the '/gitlocal' folder
mainly aimed at scalable subspace clustering

1.Subspace clustering methods are organized in folders '~/ORPCA, ~/OLRSC, ~/LRR, ~/SSC, ~/NLRRSS'

2.NLRR ('NLRR.m', 'NLRRE.m') and NLRR++ ('NLRRplus.m', 'NLRRplusE.m') functions are displayed in the folder'~/NLRRSS' ;

3.all executable files are named as 'test**.m' which can be executed directly;

4.datasets: 'Imagenet'(features trained by CNN), 'MNIST', 'SVHN', 'USPS', 'Protein';

5.clustering baseline and evaluation metric function are in the '~/clusterings' folder;
